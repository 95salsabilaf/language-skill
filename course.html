        <h3>Introducing what "English Speaking Skills" means in Speaking</h3>
        <p>Speaking is the delivery of language through the mouth. 
          To speak, we create sounds using many parts of our body, including the lungs, vocal tract, 
          vocal chords, tongue, teeth and lips.<br><br>

          Speaking is the second of the four language skills, which are:<br>
          <strong>Listening</strong><br>
          <strong>Speaking</strong><br>
          <strong>Reading</strong><br>
          <strong>Writing</strong><br><br>
          In our own language, speaking is usually the second language skill that we learn.<br>
          This vocalized form of language usually requires at least one listener. When two or more people speak or talk to each other, 
          the conversation is called a "dialogue". 
          Speech can flow naturally from one person to another in the form of dialogue. 
          It can also be planned and rehearsed, as in the delivery of a speech or presentation. 
          Of course, some people talk to themselves! In fact, some English learners practise speaking standing alone in front of a mirror.<br><br>
          
          <strong>Speaking can be formal or informal:</strong><br>
          
          Informal speaking is typically used with family and friends, or people you know well.<br>
          Formal speaking occurs in business or academic situations, or when meeting people for the first time.<br><br>
          Speaking is probably the language skill that most language learners wish to perfect as soon as possible.
          It used to be the only language skill that was difficult to practise online. This is no longer the case. 
          English learners can practise speaking online using voice or video chat and services like Skype. 
          They can also record and upload their voice for other people to listen to.

        <h3>Introducing Common Greetings</h3>
        <p><strong>Greetings in Passing</strong><br>
          It is polite to greet a person you know. 
          However, you don't always have time to stop and have a conversation. Just remember to smile as you say hello. 
          A small wave is also polite. Sometimes you pass the same person a second time on the same day. 
          You can say "hello again" or just smile.<br><br>
          <strong>Tips</strong><br>
          Slow down to greet someone you know.
          You don't have to stop what you are doing (walking, working, shopping).<br>
          Say an appropriate form of hello.<br>
          Smile and wave.<br><br>
          <strong>Useful Phrases</strong><br>
          Hello<br>
          Hi<br>
          Good morning<br>
          Good afternoon<br>
          Good evening *<br>
          Hey, John<br>
          How's it goin'? **<br><br>
          * Good night is a farewell (goodbye) phrase. It is NOT a greeting to use at night time.<br>
          ** Native speakers often shorten going to goin' in casual speech.<br><br>
          <strong>Useful Phrases</strong><br>
          Using slang in a greeting is typical between close friends. 
          Teens often use slang when they greet each other. 
          Certain English speaking countries also have their own popular form of "hello".<br>
          Howdy<br>
          Hiya<br>
          Whazzup?<br>
          Yo<br>
          G'day (Australia)<br>
